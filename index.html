        <div id="about">
            <p>Dasmodo's Arts and Crafts established during the days of the cave man is known for supplying quality products that last a 
                billion life times. All of the greats, from Micheal Angelo to Picasso and your first grade art teacher that exhibited the 
                potatoes you drew as a drawing of your family have relied on us. 
                <br><br>
                Why are we the better choice? Take the portrait of Ginevra de Benci for example - Haven't heard of it, have you? It's because 
                Da Vinci got his supplies from our competitor. Now take the Mona Lisa. Yeah, that was painted with our stuff. The Lonely Island 
                thinks Mona Lisa looks like uncooked bread. Then wait until they see Ginevra de Benci, 'cos yikes!
                <br><br>
                So please, PLEASE buy from us. Business isn't exactly booming because of digital arts that's on the rise. We have collaborated
                with Apple to manufacture the iCanvas - a digital canvas that works just like the traditional one. Like all traditional canvasses, 
                you would have to buy one for each painting you work on. But fear not! For the low price of $69420 per canvas, you can use it as a 
                tangible NFT. All you will be needing is an Apple Pencil (sold separately).
